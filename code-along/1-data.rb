# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 1
puts 2


# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 3-2 
puts 3*2.2
puts 3-(2-4)


# Strings
puts "hello, world"


# Combine strings together
 puts "hello" + "world"
puts "taco" * 3 

# Variables
food = "Tacos"
number = 3 

puts food
puts number 

puts food * number 

# Combine strings and variables

greeting = "Heyyyyy"
puts "#{greeting}, world "

welcome_message = "#{greeting}, world"

# String manipulation

puts welcome_message.reverse
